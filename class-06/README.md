# ~~Game of Greed 1~~

## Link List Deep Dive / Whiteboard

~~Today you'll begin working on a command line version of the dice game `greed` using core Python tools and understanding of the basics of the language. The game is also known as Ten Thousand, Zilch or Foo.~~

Today we are going to code out the LinkedList implementation from scratch and look at the code challenges for this week.

## Learning Objectives

Deeper understanding of LinkedList

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- ~~Modularizing components of an application~~
- ~~Risk Analysis~~
- ~~Feature prioritization~~

#### Execute

- ~~Counter module~~
- ~~Implement game logic~~
- ~~Create helper classes~~

#### Review of Feedback

##### The Good

- This weeks resume workshop
- TA Support
- Love the Pace of Nights
- In Class whitboards
- TA Code Review - Different perspective of the same problem
- Right amount of starter code, not to much, but enough to get us started
- DSA Implementation Reading - Exactly what we needed

##### The Bad  & The Ugly

- The Fast pace - Python to agressive
- TA code review feels like training
  - Having to read and understand someone elses code
- The stress of whiteboards
- Rather see text book reading vs online
    Reading assignments due on the day of vs the night before
- Falling behind
- Pair programming
- Videos no avaliable in time
- Demo's in VS Code
- DSA Documentation - Felt confused
